# INSIGHTS-INTO-COORDINATE-RELATING-TO-RADIAL-VELOCITY-MEASUREMENT-OF-NGC-7531

This project aims to construct a suitable model to describe the association between the measured radial velocity of NGC 7531 and the coordinates of positions in the sky from which it is measured. We assume a Gaussian error with homoscedasticity on the measurements and constructed models using ordinary least squares, regularized least squares with $\ell^2$ norm penalty, cubic polynomials, and cubic B-splines additive model in this project. After assessing their performances using the AIC, training error, and estimated mean prediction squared error via cross-validation, we select the cubic B-splines additive model as the final model to make inferences about the association between the measured radial velocity of NGC 7531 and its coordinates. 

This project was complete as part of my coursework requirement in STAT 444 (Advanced Regression) at the University of Waterloo. I would like to thank H. LUO, J. ZHAO, W. ZHAO for contributing to this project together.
